        <h1>Dead souls</h1>
        <p>
        Whoever you are, my reader, no matter what place you stand, no matter what rank you are in, whether you are respected by a higher rank or a person of a simple class, but if God has taught you to read and write and my book has already fallen into your hands, I ask you help me. <br>
        The book before you, which you have probably already read in its first edition, depicts a man taken from our own state. <br>
        He travels around our Russian land, meeting people of all classes, from noble to simple.
